This is a Linux console driver for a HD44780 LCD connected to a PC-style
parallel port. It supports both 4-bit and 8-bit interface mode.

The code was developed and used with a 20x4 LCD connected to the parallel port
of a standard PC and a CHRP LongTrail PowerPC box, with Linux kernel 2.2
(early development) and 2.4, from 2000 until 2004. There's no guarantee it will
work with more recent kernels.

The console driver has a comment suggesting to use a 20x4 window on an 80x25
virtual screen, but this has never been implemented.

It consists of 4 modules:
  - hd44780: Mid-level HD44780 LCD driver, handling the HD44780 commands
             [kernel, user]
  - parlcd: Low-level HD44780 driver, defining how to talk to a HD44780 LCD
            connected to a PC-style parallel port [kernel, user]
  - lcdcon: Standard Linux console driver for a HD44780 LCD [kernel]
  - play: Interactive test program to talk to the HD44780 or to the raw
          parallel port [user]

Modules marked [kernel] are used inside the Linux kernel only.
Modules marked [user] are used with the userspace test program.

Have fun!
